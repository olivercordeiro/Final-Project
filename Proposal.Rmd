For my final project I am going to use the PGA tour data along with Peter George and Grant Fairbairn. The data goes back to 1983 so I intend to look at trends over the past 35 years and maybe try to see what variables correlate with winning tournaments. 

```{r}
#hole2018 <- read_excel("hole2018.xlsx")
```
