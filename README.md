# PGA Tour Strokes Gained 


## Topic
There is an saying in golf that goes "Drive for Show and Putt for Dough." For those not familiar with golf the expression basically means that while a long drive is impressive to watch, it is the putter that wins tournaments. In this project I hope to find if this saying holds any merit. 

I am working with data from the PGA Tour, looking at their strokes gained statistic for the top three players in the world in 2018, Brooks Koepka, Justin Rose and Dustin Johnson as well as Tiger Woods' comeback season. 


## Motivation
I was inspired to look at these data by my passion for the game of golf. As a member of the Harvard University golf team I hoped that I might find some insight that might help to improve my game. 


## Background
In order to better understand my project it will be helpful to understand the strokes gained statistic developed by the PGA Tour. In short, the strokes gained statistic measures how a player performs in certain areas against the rest of the field. These areas consist of Off the Tee, Tee to Green, Approach, Around the Green and Total. 

If, on a certain day, a player shoots a 69 and the tournament average is 72 then that player will have gained three strokes on the field. The statistic uses a combination of distance to the pin, location (fairway or rough) and other factors to calculate a baseline and then compares it with the player's result to see if they gained or lost strokes. Here is a link to the PGA Tour's website where they explain their detailed calculations:
